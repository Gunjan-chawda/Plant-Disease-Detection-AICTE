Plant Disease Detection System

This project is developed as part of the AICTE-Edunet Foundation initiative. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify various plant leaf diseases from images.

Methodology:
- Image collection: 38 classes
- Preprocessing: Rescaling, Augmentation
- Model: CNN with Conv2D layers
- Training: 7 epochs on GPU
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Loss
  
Results:
- Achieved accuracy: 92%
- Trained with early stopping and checkpoints
